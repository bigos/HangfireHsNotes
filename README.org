* HangfireHs Notes

This repo is for notes about the [[https://github.com/bigos/HangfireHs][HangfireHs]] project.

I use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode][Org-mode]] because it is easier for me, but I am open to other suggestions.
Still, you can edit those file using a regular test editor, so small
contributions should not be a problem.

issues
